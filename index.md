<h1>Hi, I'm Andrea :wave:</h1>

I'm a **web developer**, **learning designer** and **gaming enthusiast** based in **Vancouver, BC**.

My current programming focus is on [JavaScript](/tags/javascript.html), React and [NextJS](/tags/nextjs.html). [Check out my programming projects here](/programming/). I'm also sharing my knowledge and learnings [on my blog](/tags/programming.html). 

My background is in language teaching. [I've authored Italian language digital textbooks and online courses](/learning/) that encourage learners to develop their own curiosity and agency. 

<!-- Add tags when there are more posts about these topics -->

I am also interested in gaming of all kinds. I enjoy board games, videogames and, above all, tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). 

My other passions are media (film, TV, sci-fi/fantasy fiction), productivity and personal knowledge management.
